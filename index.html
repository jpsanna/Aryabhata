            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhatta was born in a small place called Pataliputra(present day Patna, Bihar) during the Gupta dynasty dated around 13 April 476 CE.
            It was discovered that Aryabhatta had set up an observatory at the Sun temple in the Taregna district of Bihar for his astronomical observatory works.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhatta contributed significantly to mathematics for discovering various trigonometric functions that are useful in the modern era.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">He is said to have invented "zero", a discovery that helped the world solve many of its issues.
            Aryabhata presented the five laws of mathematics in a poem to explain the rotation of the Earth on its axis.
            Aryabhatta wrote three books on astronomy and only one book called the Aryabhata is in existence and is available today.
            The three books written by Aryabhatta are called Das Jeetika, Aryabhatiyam, and Tantra.
            Aryabhatta's inventions and formulas at that point of time crossed India's borders and were celebrated worldwide.
            Today, the scientific community is forever grateful for the innovations and formulas of Aryabhatta, which have led to science and the world's progress.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhata's works in Mathematics include arithmetic, spherical trigonometry, algebra, and plane trigonometry along with other sections such as continued fractions, sums-of-power series, quadratic equations, and sine tables. Aryabhatta worked out the value of the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14) used today by several scientists and mathematicians worldwide. Aryabhatta proposed the geocentric model of the solar system which states that the Earth is the center of the universe and the Sun, the moon, and the planets revolve around it.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhatta was an Indian astronomer who discovered the entire solar system model and put forth the concept of revolution and rotation of planets. The book Aryabhatia consists of details on the Aryabhatta's lost works such as the Solar System's motion, Sidereal Rotation periods and Heliocentrism, and details of Eclipses.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">The life of Aryabhatta is often taught to children worldwide because his life story is filled with inspiration and struggles, and most of his scientific discoveries were frowned upon by religious leaders. Aryabhatta is an inspiring personality as he stood up against the entire society of blind belief and established his scientific theories during the period of strict social norms.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhatta implemented multiple cultures and idiosyncrasies from the Hindu scriptures to discover several theories and formulas in Mathematics, one of which was calculating the area of a triangle and the volume of a sphere that became the source of origin for various inventions and discoveries in engineering today. Aryabhatta's discoveries and inventions led to various other theories in the fields from physics to medicine to engineering.
            </p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Most of Aryabhatta's initial inventions received ridicule reactions and were all rejected by religious elders and people back then. He broke all the religious stereotypes and social stigma during that time. He rose above all the difficulties to become the first mathematician and scientist of India with the discovery of multiple theories on modern science and mathematics.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">He was the first to find that the sidereal year is 365 days, with six hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds working module which varies with three minutes and 20 seconds over the modern-day value.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhatta wrote multiple books. His mathematical books deal with various theories about algebra, trigonometry, quadratic equations, arithmetic, and many more that have great value and are being used even today.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhata also explained the solar and lunar eclipses in his book and a proposal that describes the appearance of the moon due to the reflection of the sunlight. He also elucidates in his book about the lunar eclipse and the solar eclipse. He hypothesizes that eclipses take place by the shadow-casting of the Earth and the moon.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">The book Aryabhatiya comprises the description of multiple astronomical instruments invented by Aryabhatta like the gnomon, a cylindrical stick, shadow instrument, two types of water clocks- bow-shaped and cylindrical, possibly angle-measuring devices, umbrella-shaped devices, and semicircular and circular devices.</p>

            <p class="who-is-para">Aryabhatta died in 550 CE at the age of 74.</p>
