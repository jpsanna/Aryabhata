    <h1>Theories of Aryabhata:</h1>
    <p>Aryabhatta and his discoveries have been revolutionary, not only for mathematics but for astronomy as well. The heliocentric theory he gave explained the planets' revolution around the sun. He has also calculated the speeds of the earth and sidereal rotation
        solar system rotation, approximation of pi, trigonometry, place value system and zero.
        </p>
        <p>Aryabhata's astronomical system was known as the audAyaka system. Scientists made several discoveries based on his discoveries such as that planets and moon in the solar system are lightened by sunlight only. He gave the theory that Earth rotates on its axis only.</p>
        <h1>Some theories and concepts associated with Aryabhata include:</h1>
        <p>Trigonometric Formulas: Aryabhata made advancements in trigonometry and provided trigonometric tables that helped in calculating the values of trigonometric functions.</p>
        <p>Heliocentrism: Aryabhata proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system, where he suggested that the Earth rotates on its axis and that the planets, including the Earth, orbit the Sun. This idea was revolutionary for its time.
            Equations and Algebra: Aryabhata worked on solving linear and quadratic equations, as well as indeterminate equations. His contributions laid the foundation for further developments in algebra.
            </p>
            <p>Computation of Astronomical Quantities: Aryabhata calculated various astronomical quantities, such as the length of the year and the positions of celestial bodies.</p>
